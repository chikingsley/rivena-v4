/*
test("LoginForm renders correctly", () => {
  // Would check that important elements are in the document
});

test("LoginForm shows validation errors", async () => {
  // Would check validation error display
});

test("LoginForm calls signIn.email on valid submission", async () => {
  // Would check form submission
});

test("LoginForm calls social sign-in methods", async () => {
  // Would check social sign-in buttons
});
