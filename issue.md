Bun has several issues. The first issue is with environmental variables. It cannot load environmental variables at all, whether that's `process.env` or `import.meta.env`. The only way to load environmental variables is to explicitly declare them in an `env.ts` file and import them like that, which is a decent workaround but not ideal. The other thing that Bun has issues with is SWR, and specifically, it has issues with SWR from Clerk. Clerk uses a newer SWR that is not compatible with Bun, and you end up with a bunch of errors if you try to use it, so you cannot use native Clerk components if you are using Bun. I started looking at other libraries like Supabase Auth or Better Auth in general. Better Auth did work for some time and still works. The only beef that I have with Better Auth is that it is somewhat complex to set up on its own. I'm also finding that Convex Auth is pretty difficult to set up on its own. Everything requires some level of configuration and setup, which is annoying. You more or less just want authentication to work. I don't like fucking with authentication when life is already difficult with everything else we have going on. Why would we trouble with authentication that's tough? That being said, it is what it is.

We have to move on. We have to live our best life. So we will try something else.
